# Contributing guidelines...
Please follow these guidelines when pushing new changes.

## Do NOT push to master.
If you have a change, no matter how small or big, you should NOT push to master.

To contribute, `git checkout master` on your local repository, `git pull` the changes from master.
To start working on your new change (feature, fix, etc...) make a new branch (DO NOT CHECKOUT AN OLD BRANCH) `git checkout -b feat/new-feature-name` and work on the new branch.
You can make as many commits as you like in the new branch. 
After you have finished working on your changes, commit the changes, and push them to upstream: `git commit -m 'describe your change'; git push --set-upstream origin feat/new-feature-name`

This last command makes a new branch on the remote branch.
After you have created the branch, you can rebase it on master in GitHub.


This workflow ensures that no conflicts occur on the master branch. please abide by the workflow and contact me (youssef) if you need any clarification or help.

Happy coding!
